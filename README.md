Hand Gesture-Based Brightness Control
This project allows users to control their screen brightness using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It utilizes computer vision to track hand gestures and adjusts the brightness of the system based on the user's hand position or specific gestures.

Features
Real-time Gesture Detection: Detects hand movements in real-time using a webcam.
Brightness Control: Adjusts the screen brightness based on the distance or position of the hand.
Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface that requires minimal setup.
Customizable: Option to configure gesture sensitivity and brightness levels.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
OpenCV (for real-time video processing)
Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
Screen brightness control library:
screen-brightness-control (for Windows)
xrandr (for Linux)
brightness command (for macOS)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RushikuwarRK/gesture-brightness-control.git
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Linux users, ensure xrandr is installed:

sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
For macOS users, install brightness utility:

brew install brightness
Usage
Run the Python script:
python gesture_brightness_control.py
Adjusting Brightness:

Move your hand closer or farther from the camera to increase or decrease brightness.
Optionally, gestures such as raising or lowering your hand can also be configured for brightness control.
Exiting:

Press Q on your keyboard to exit the program.
Configuration
You can modify the sensitivity of gesture recognition and brightness adjustment by editing the configuration settings in the script:
python
Copy code
# Adjust sensitivity
GESTURE_SENSITIVITY = 0.1  # Lower value = more sensitive

# Brightness range
MIN_BRIGHTNESS = 10
MAX_BRIGHTNESS = 100
Troubleshooting
Webcam not detected: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and recognized by your operating system.
Brightness not changing: Check if the correct brightness control utility is installed and working for your operating system.
